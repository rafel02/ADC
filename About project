***ADC*** 

Arduio have 5 ADC pin. ADC input voltage is 0 - 5V. ADC resolutionis 10 bit. Digital value range 
is from 0 to 2^10 (1023).  Resoultion is Vmax/ AdcRang. Digital input is Vin / Resolution.

***Formula for voltage calculation***

ADC value is digital value for input voltage. This value is to change to voltage. Formula for 
change input value to voltage is Aout = digital value * (Vref/2^n â€“ 1).

 ***Example***

Digital value = 512 and ADC is 10-bit with 5V Vref. But, we want to know that for what analog voltage it is giving respective digital value. Then,

Aout = 512 * (5 V / 1023) = 2.5 V
